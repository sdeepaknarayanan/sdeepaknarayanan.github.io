Recent years have seen a decline in air quality across the planet,
with studies suggesting that air pollution is a significant cause of
death. Governments have set up large scale air quality monitoring
stations in various locations in their countries that can help aid
them formulate policies to tackle this unforeseen decline in air qual-
ity. However, these air quality stations are expensive to install and
have thus been often sparsely deployed. Motivated by sparse air
quality monitoring and the expensive cost of air quality monitoring
stations, we propose an active learning based solution to recom-
mend locations to install air quality monitoring stations. We use a
Gaussian Processes based approach for this purpose, motivated by
their ability to encode prior knowledge using custom kernels. We
empirically show that our proposed approach outperforms several
baselines.
