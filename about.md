<p>Welcome to my webpage! I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research (MSR) India. Before joining MSR, I earned my Bachelor's from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar where I worked on research problems arising in computational sustainability and large scale machine learning. During my time at IIT, I was also fortunate to spend a summer at Caltech, building software for real-time streaming applications.

I am currently interested in developing algorithms for large scale machine learning problems arising in practice.
