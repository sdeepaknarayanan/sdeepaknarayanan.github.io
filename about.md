<p>I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. Before joining MSR, I earned my Bachelor's from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar where I worked on research problems arising in computational sustainability and large scale machine learning.</p>

<p>
I am currently interested in developing algorithms for large scale machine learning problems arising in practice.
